Alright, let's break down your example into a detailed image layout plan using the split ratio method you described. We'll follow the rules you've specified, focusing on separating elements and their attributes into different regions while maintaining a logical and aesthetically pleasing composition.
 ### Original Caption:
 "IT worker coding on her laptop in her office environment."
 ### Key phrases identification:
 We identify an IT worker with attributes: Coding on laptop, office environment, so we hierarchically split these features.
 1. IT worker (The central character)
 2. Coding on laptop (Worker's action)
 3. Office environment (Background or surrounding)
 So we need to split the image into 3 subregions.
 ### Split Ratio Planning:
 #### Horizontal Split Ratio: `2;1;1` 
 - This ratio splits the image into three horizontal rows, with the IT worker and her action occupying a larger portion of the image.
 #### Vertical Split Ratio: None
 - Here in this caption, we don't need to split the image vertically, so we don't need to specify the vertical split ratio.
 #### Detailed Subregion Prompts:
 1. **First Row** (`2`):
    - **Region 0:** Detail of IT worker's upper body, both hands on the laptop keyboard, focused expression as she works.
 2. **Second Row** (`1`):
    - **Region 1:** Close-up of the laptop screen, a coding software interface is open with lines of code visible, signaling deep involvement in work.
 3. **Third Row** (`1`):
    - **Region 2:** Capture of the office surroundings - modern desk, ergonomic chair, ambient lighting, maybe some stationery items, giving viewers a sense of workspace.
 #### Composition Logic:
 - The first row highlights the IT worker, focusing on her posture and expression while working, creating a central point of interest in the image.
 - The second row showcases the laptop with coding interface, a key element telling the nature of her work. This section emphasizes the seriousness and dedication in her work.
 - The third row captures the office environment, a significant aspect in the image showing the extended workspace where she works.
 #### Aesthetic Considerations:
 - The IT worker in the first row introduces a serious and diligent atmosphere to the image, also setting the tone of the IT industry's challenging and problem-solving nature.
 - The laptop with code interface in the second row engages the viewer into the IT worker's world, giving an impression of her expertise and knowledge.
 - The office environment in the third row provides a broader context of the workspace, completing the whole picture of her profession and working conditions.
 By following this plan, each region effectively captures distinct elements of the IT worker's world, using descriptive words to highlight objects, actions, and contexts. The overall layout is designed to be visually engaging and harmonious, creating an image that richly illustrates the professional life of an IT worker.
 Now, let's output the split ratio and regional prompt we get in the planning process.
 ### Output:
 Horizontal split ratio: 2;1;1
 Vertical split ratio: None
 Split ratio: 2;1;1
 Regional Prompt: Detail of IT worker's upper body, both hands on the laptop keyboard, focused expression as she works. BREAK
 Close-up of the laptop screen, a coding software interface is open with lines of code visible, signaling deep involvement in work. BREAK
 Capture of the office surroundings - modern desk, ergonomic chair, ambient lighting, maybe some stationery items, giving viewers a sense of workspace.
Horizontal split ratio: 2;1;1
 Vertical split ratio: None
 Split ratio: 2;1;1
 Regional Prompt: Detail of IT worker's upper body, both hands on the laptop keyboard, focused expression as she works. BREAK
 Close-up of the laptop screen, a coding software interface is open with lines of code visible, signaling deep involvement in work. BREAK
 Capture of the office surroundings - modern desk, ergonomic chair, ambient lighting, maybe some stationery items, giving viewers a sense of workspace.
