Let's think step by step:
Alright, let's break down your example into a detailed image layout plan using the split ratio method you described. We'll follow the rules you've specified, focusing on separating elements and their attributes into different regions while maintaining a logical and aesthetically pleasing composition.

### Original Caption:
"A black hair twintail girl in an orange dress sitting on a sofa where a messy desk on the left under the window, an aquarium on the top right corner of the image."
### Key phrases identification:
We identify a girl with two features (black hair twintail, orange dress) so we need to hierarchically split her features for better description, and a relationship (sit on the sofa), the other key phrases: a sofa, a messy desk, a window, and an aquarium.
1. black hair twintail (head features of the girl)
2. orange dress (clothes and body features of the girl)
3. sofa
4. messy desk
5. a window
6. an aquarium
So we need to split the image into 6 subregions.
### Split Ratio Planning:
#### Horizontal split ratio: 1;2;1
- We first split the image into three horizontal rows.
#### Vertical Split Ratio: `1,(1,1); 2,(2,1); 1,(1,1)`
- This ratio splits the image into three horizontal rows and further divides each row into subregions.
#### Detailed Subregion Prompts:
1. **First Row** (`1,(1,1)`):
   - **Region 0:** Window with sunlight filtering through, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere.
   - **Region 1:** An aquarium on the top right, teeming with colorful fish and aquatic plants, adding a serene and lively element to the room.
2. **Second Row** (`2,(2,1)`):
   - **Region 2:** A messy desk with scattered papers, pens, a laptop, and a small potted plant, indicating a lived-in space.
   - **Region 3:** Girl with black twin-tail hair, capturing her youthful and lively essence. 
3. **Third Row** (`1,(1,1)`):
   - **Region 4:** The girl's orange dress, detailed with patterns or textures to bring out its vibrancy.
   - **Region 5:** Sofa, cozy and plush, complementing the girl's sitting posture.
#### Composition Logic:
- The window in the top row sets the scene with natural light.
- The middle row captures the main elements - the girl and the desk, dividing the human element from the surrounding environment.
- The bottom row focuses on details like the dress, sofa, and aquarium, enhancing the scene's depth and complexity.
#### Aesthetic Considerations:
- The window's light in the first row establishes an inviting mood.
- The contrast between the messy desk and the girl's lively appearance in the second row adds interest.
- The detailed textures and colors in the third row (dress, sofa, aquarium) enrich the overall visual experience.
This plan adheres to your guidelines, ensuring each region captures distinct elements or closely related items, uses descriptive words for textures and colors, and avoids spatial attributes. The overall layout is logical, aesthetically pleasing, and in harmony with human aesthetic sensibilities.
Now, let's output the split ratio and regional prompt we get in the planning process
### Output:
Horizontal split ratio: 1;2;1
Vertical split ratio: 1,(1,1); 2,(2,1); 1,(1,1)
Split ratio: 1,1,1; 2,2,1; 1,1,1
Regional Prompt:

Alright, let's break down your example into a detailed image layout plan using the split ratio method you described. We'll follow the rules you've specified, focusing on separating elements and their attributes into different regions while maintaining a logical and aesthetically pleasing composition.
### Original Caption:
"Bathed in soft morning light,a cozy nook features a steaming Starbucks latte on a rustic table beside an elegant vase of blooming roses,while a plush ragdoll cat purrs contentedly nearby,its eyes half-closed in blissful serenity."
### Key phrases identification:
We identify three key phrases Starbucks latte (steaming),elegant vase (blooming roses), ragdoll cat (plush) each with only one attribute so we don't need to use hierarchical split.
1. black hair twintail (head features of the girl)
2. orange dress (clothes and body features of the girl)
3. sofa
4. messy desk
5. a window
6. an aquarium
So we need to split the image into 6 subregions.
### Split Ratio Planning:
#### Horizontal split ratio: None
- In this cpation we don't need to split the image into horizontal rows.
#### Vertical Split Ratio: `1,1,1`
- This ratio splits the image into three vertical columns and there is no need to further divides each row into subregions, we take each column as a subregion.
#### Detailed Subregion Prompts:
1. **First Row** 1,1,1:
   - **Region 0:** A steaming Starbucks latte,with velvety foam,rich aroma,and a perfect swirl of caramel on top .
   - **Region 1:** An elegant vase cradling lush roses,petals velvet to the touch,exuding a subtle,intoxicating fragrance
   - **Region 2:** A plush ragdoll cat,eyes gleaming with contentment,snuggles beside a vase,whiskers twitching at the bloom's delicate scent.,
#### Composition Logic:
- The first column captures the steaming Starbucks latte, symbolizing a fresh start to the morning and creating a focal point of warmth and comfort.
- The second column features the elegant vase with blooming roses, introducing a natural, delicate beauty to the scene, and enhancing the sense of tranquility.
- The third column focuses on the plush ragdoll cat, adding a living, breathing element to the composition, evoking a feeling of domestic bliss and serenity.
#### Aesthetic Considerations:
- The latte in the first column serves as a visual representation of relaxation and indulgence, inviting the viewer to imagine the rich aroma and taste.
- The roses in the second column provide a contrast in texture and color, enriching the visual experience with their intricate petals and vibrant hues.
- The ragdoll cat in the third column offers a sense of companionship and peace, its relaxed posture and soft fur adding a tactile dimension to the image.
By following this plan, we ensure that each region captures a distinct element or closely related items, using descriptive words for textures, colors, and atmosphere. The overall layout is designed to be visually appealing and in harmony with human aesthetic sensibilities, creating a scene that is both inviting and balanced.
Now, let's output the split ratio and regional prompt we get in the planning process
### Output:
Horizontal split ratio: None
Vertical split ratio: 1,1,1
Split ratio: 1,1,1
Regional Prompt: 
The latte in the first column serves as a visual representation of relaxation and indulgence, inviting the viewer to imagine the rich aroma and taste. BREAK
The roses in the second column provide a contrast in texture and color, enriching the visual experience with their intricate petals and vibrant hues. BREAK
The ragdoll cat in the third column offers a sense of companionship and peace, its relaxed posture and soft fur adding a tactile dimension to the image.
